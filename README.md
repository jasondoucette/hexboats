# Hexboats

Command line Battleship game where fire control involves a hex to decimal
conversion. Basically an excuse to teach my son hexadecimal numbering.

## Usage

Run `hexboats.py` and start shooting. Firing coordinates are the decimal
equivalents of 0xXY, e.g. to shoot column 3, row 4 you'd want 0x34 so you'd
enter 52.

The computer currently shoots randomly, but that doesn't need to improve
until my kid can actually win a game :)
